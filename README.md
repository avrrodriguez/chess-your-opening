# Chess Your Opening
(Back end)

## Introduction
Often times the first 10 moves of a chess game can be enough to determine who wins and loses. Looking over websites and chess books, I felt like the entry point for openings in chess was a bit difficult. A person would have a lot of motivation and love for chess to be able to read through pages and pages of chess notation stating moves of openings and their variation. I felt like something a bit more beginner friendly was needed so that they can ease their way into learning about openings.

## Description
In this git hub repo is the back end for the application, you can find the front end I built [here](https://github.com/avrrodriguez/chess-your-opening-frontend). 

- It is a RESTful API with MVC architecture built with Ruby on Rails.
- It has User authentication using JSON web tokens.
- It can store information about openings, studies, resources for openings, and common positions of openings.
